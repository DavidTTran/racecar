#Ruby Challenge!

What is a palindrome? A palindrome is something that is read the same forward as it is backwards.

For example,
- racecar
- kayak
- my gym
- Was it a cat I saw?
- Step on no pets
- 878
- 123454321


##Your challenge:

During this hour, you will be challenged to review your raw ruby skills.

Write a script in the palindrome.rb file that finds all numbers between 1 and 1000 that when reversed, and added to itself, create a numeric palindrome.

 examples:
  - 50, because 50 + 05 = 55 and 55 is the same forward and backward
  - 47, because 47 + 74 = 121 and 121 is the same forward and backward
  - 513, because 513 + 315 = 828 and 828 is the same forward and backward

To run the code that you write in the palindrome.rb file, run `ruby palindrome.rb`.
